HackSecret 5,"Overview
Secret Network enables developers to build decentralized applications with encrypted data, both natively on Secret and on other blockchains through cross-chain communication, as well as confidential AI, unlocking powerful new use-cases for Web3. This is known as Decentralized Confidential Computing, or DeCC.
HackSecret 5 is an opportunity to build cutting-edge AI applications for the Cosmos, EVM, Solana, and Autonomys Network. The hackathon leverages Secret Network's Secret AI and decentralized confidential computing (DeCC) capabilities alongside Autonomys Network's Agents Framework and decentralized permanent storage Auto-Drive.
With Secret AI SDK, users can ensure that their interactions remain private and protected against unauthorized access. If you are a developer from another ecosystem who has never worked with Secret contracts before, have no fear! Our developer toolkits will teach you everything you need to know to get started and win prizes.
Confidential AI unlocks exciting new use-cases, and Secret Network's Secret AI enables developers to do this while building on nearly any blockchain! This hackathon includes four tracks, one for confidential AI applications using Secret AI SDK, Autonomys Network's Agents Framework, cross-chain applications (IBC, EVM, or Solana), and one for native Secret applications. The choice is yours!
If you have questions, you can contact the Secret Network team, or join the Secret Network Developer Telegram or Discord. Also, be sure to check out our HackSecret 5 event schedule, which includes workshops and open discussion sessions.

"Verifiable AI, save the world with cheqd","Welcome to the AI TruthRise Hackathon: Shaping the Future of Trust in AI
Artificial Intelligence is no longer just a tool; it’s redefining industries, creating new opportunities, and reshaping human interaction. From personalised assistants to content creation, AI has become a powerful enabler of progress. But with great power comes an unsettling consequence: distrust.
We’re entering an era where the boundary between real and synthetic blurs. In Hong Kong, a UK engineering firm fell victim to a £20 million scam through an AI-generated deepfake video call. Meanwhile, in France, a woman was conned out of €830,000 by criminals impersonating actor Brad Pitt using advanced AI technology. These aren’t fictional horror stories — they’re real world examples of how AI can be exploited to deceive and manipulate, threatening trust at its very core.
As AI’s capabilities grow, so does the urgency to address these challenges. The pressing question isn’t can we build advanced AI systems? But rather how can we ensure they are trustworthy, transparent, and ethical?
Rebuilding Trust in the AI-Driven World
The solution lies in verifiable, secure, and ethical AI systems. This is where the AI TruthRise Hackathon comes in — a collaborative space for builders, creators, and visionaries to design a future where trust and AI coexist.
Imagine a world where:
AI agents act transparently and ethically, ensuring they represent the true interests of users. Content credentials authenticate AI-generated images, videos, and text, safeguarding against deepfakes and disinformation. Verified datasets ensure AI is built on ethical, accurate, and unbiased information. At cheqd, we are committed to leading this transformation. By empowering innovators with the tools to create verifiable AI solutions, we’re setting the stage for trust-first AI ecosystems.
The AI TruthRise Hackathon is a rallying call to restore trust in AI and shape the future of a more secure, transparent, and ethical AI landscape. Join us as we build solutions that don’t just imagine a better future — they create it. Let’s rise to the challenge, together.
Tracks and prizes
Tracks
During the hackathon, participants will tackle challenges that align with three key pillars:

Intro to core technologies
Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):
cheqd uses DIDs to identify companies and their associated public keys on its blockchain. Through these identifiers, companies can sign digital documents known as Verifiable Credentials, that can be issued to individuals or organisations to attest a particular attribute or set of attributes.
Find the DID Core spec here
Find cheqd’s docs to start building here
Verifiable Credentials:
Using cheqd’s APIs or SDKs, builders can issue Verifiable Credentials to digital identity wallets, cryptographically signed by the DIDs on cheqd’s blockchain network. These can be used for providing individuals or organisations with a reusable, portable and verifiable way of presenting facts or attributes about themselves to third parties, without reliance on a centralized intermediary.
Find the VC Data Model spec here
Find cheqd’s docs to start building here
DID-Linked Resources (DLRs):
Using DLRs, builders can append any file to a DID. This can be used for various purposes, such as storing metadata to a companies’ identifier, or information pertaining to a set of issued credentials, e.g., status lists, trust registries, schemas, company logo, governance documents.
Find the DLR spec here
Find cheqd’s docs to start building here
Payment-Gated Resources:
Builders can create flows where in order to access a DLR, a payment needs to be made to the controller of the DLR $CHEQ account. This creates the opportunity for customisable commercial models alongside the flow of Verifiable Credentials, for example, to incentivise issuance of VCs, an issuer may charge for access to a particular subset of verification data, such as a status list.
Find cheqd’s docs to start building here
$CHEQ token:
All identity transactions on the cheqd blockchain network incur a $CHEQ transaction fee, including the writing of DIDs and DLRs. Recently, cheqd has introduced the concept of fee abstraction, meaning that any transaction can also be made in an IBC denomination, such as USDC on cheqd.
See cheqd’s website for information on acquiring $CHEQ tokens here
All of cheqd’s identity functionality is available via either:
cheqd Studio: A set of enterprise ready APIs for implementing cheqd’s identity functionality with low effort. Get started for free here
cheqd SDKs: A wide range of supported libraries and protocols contained in SDKs, for different credential formats and exchange options - in different coding languages. Find the SDK for you here

TON Global BTCFi Hackathon,"🔎 TON Global BTCFi Hackathon Overview
The BTCFi Hackathon, hosted by TONX, TonBit, TON Foundation, TON Society, and TON Core, brings together innovators worldwide to revolutionize how Bitcoin integrates with the TON and Telegram ecosystems. This premier event accelerates the MASS ADOPTION of tgBTC, unlocking groundbreaking opportunities in blockchain. Join us to #BuildOnTON and shape the future of blockchain technology.
👨‍🏫 Intro to TON Teleport BTC
TON (The Open Network) was envisioned as a “blockchain of blockchains,” aiming to integrate key Web3 services within a unified ecosystem. TON Teleport BTC is a significant step toward this goal — a trustless, decentralized bridge that brings Bitcoin directly into TON. TON Teleport BTC combines Bitcoin’s renowned security with TON’s speed and scalability.
TON Teleport BTC enables users to securely transfer BTC between the Bitcoin and TON networks without relying on central intermediaries. Inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto’s ideal of a system based on “cryptographic proof instead of trust,” TON Teleport BTC removes third-party control, ensuring each BTC on TON is fully backed by actual BTC on the Bitcoin network.
By integrating Bitcoin with TON’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, TON Teleport BTC transforms BTC from a store of value into a versatile financial tool. Users can utilize BTC within dApps, lending platforms, and decentralized exchanges, while the infrastructure sets the stage for broader cross-chain integrations.
TON Teleport BTC aims to make TON a central hub for blockchain assets, connecting Bitcoin to TON in a secure, decentralized way. This trustless bridge upholds TON’s mission of censorship resistance and asset freedom, opening doors for seamless, user-controlled asset management across Web3.

Use Cases
Overview: From the Wikipedia page for SpaceX Starship, the lift capability of a fully reusable Starship is at least 100 tones to LEO. From there, lift capability drops significantly (only about 20 tonnes to GTO, for example), but the possibility of on-orbit refueling can provide the capability to lift 100 tonnes into essentially arbitrary trajectories, limited only by fuel availability. The payload bay is 8m in diameter and 17m long (although heavily tapered toward the nose). Considering this impressive lifting capacity, we've thoughtfully curated the unique use cases and open challenges below. These scenarios provide an excellent opportunity for you to showcase your engineering expertise and explore your imaginative potential as you create your design blueprints.

Wallet Risk Scoring on Base,"Wallet Risk Scoring on Base cohosted with Base, Hyperbolic, Virtuals and Pond. For more details and submit your models, please visit: https://cryptopond.xyz/modelFactory/detail/65
Assess wallet risk levels by analyzing transaction histories, wallet-to-wallet transfers, and other on-chain activities.
Overview
In the blockchain ecosystem, transactions occur in a decentralized, anonymous manner. While this feature provides freedom and security, it also enables fraudulent activities like money laundering, Sybil attacks, and other illegal operations. For decentralized finance (DeFi) organizations, exchanges, and regulators, identifying and assessing wallet risk has become a critical challenge.
While blockchain provides transparency by publicly recording all transactions, interpreting these transactions presents significant challenges. Fraudulent activities often hide within millions of daily transactions, and wallets involved in illegal activities can undermine blockchain protocols' stability and reputation. This situation demands an automated, efficient tool to evaluate wallet risk levels based on transaction history and on-chain behavior.
Currently, determining a blockchain wallet's risk level lacks quick, reliable methods. Traditional manual or rule-based approaches prove inadequate and can't scale to handle large transaction volumes. This limitation creates several risks:
Delayed detection of illegal transactions
Financial losses for DeFi organizations and exchanges due to high-risk wallet interactions
Non-compliance with AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations
Inadequate risk management of blockchain wallets threatens both ecosystem security and legal compliance. A wallet risk scoring system would:
Improve security: Reduce illegal and fraudulent blockchain transactions
Support regulatory compliance: Ensure blockchain organizations meet AML and KYC requirements
Build Trust: Strengthen user confidence in blockchain and DeFi services
Optimize operations: Help organizations save time and costs when checking wallet legitimacy
If you are unfamiliar with the basic concepts in Crypto such as tokens and wallets, please start with our blog post ""Blockchain 101"". Otherwise, let's dive in! Below is the competition process.
The online phase of this competition runs for 7 weeks. During this period, you may submit your model results up to 3 times per day. Half of the records in your submission file will be used for initial evaluation, with preliminary scores displayed on the Leaderboard.
At the end of week 7, you must submit your best model result before the submission portal closes. The remaining half of the records in your best submission will be used to determine the final score. The top 10 model developers will be notified and advance to the second round, where they'll present their work to a committee of AI leaders from the competition hosts. If notified, please respond within 48 hours or you lose your spot to the next-ranked developer.
During week 8, these finalists will prepare their presentations and upload their models according to Pond's technical specifications. Presentations occur at the end of week 8, with final rankings determined by both evaluation scores and committee feedback. The top 3 developers will receive their prizes after their models are successfully verified and deployed to Pond Models platform. The prizes are: 1st place will be awarded $4000, 2nd place $2000, and 3rd place $1000. Additionally, revenue from the models’ future usage will be distributed back to their developers proportionally."

HashKey Hackerhouse Taichu,"In the rapid development of blockchain technology, we have witnessed the evolution from the initial Bitcoin payment system to the breakthrough of Ethereum smart contracts, and then to the wave of financial innovation brought by DeFi. While this creative field has brought countless possibilities, it has also undergone many tests. The DeFi Summer frenzy of 2020 and the lessons from the FTX incident in 2022 remind us that truly lasting innovation must be built on a solid foundation of regulatory compliance.
Compliance is not an obstacle to innovation, but rather a necessary path toward industry maturity. Looking at the development of DEX, more and more projects are beginning to integrate compliance requirements into the core of product design, ensuring operational standardization while maintaining innovative vitality. This transformation marks blockchain industry's entry into a new stage of development.
Against this background, we are organizing this hackathon to invite developers worldwide to explore the innovative space of blockchain technology within a compliance framework. There are great opportunities in various areas, whether it's identity authentication solutions and KYC/AML systems at the infrastructure level, or compliant DeFi protocols and regulatory technology tools at the application level. We look forward to seeing more innovative solutions that both follow regulatory requirements and create real value for users.
This is an exciting moment, as innovation and compliance mutually reinforce each other, which will help blockchain technology achieve broader applications and bring tangible value to more users. Let us work together to build a healthier and more sustainable blockchain ecosystem.
All projects with quality potential will have the opportunity to receive Hashkey Grant and incubation support."

🏆 About Quadratic Voting
“It’s a framework that gives the power back to the people and the community at large, and no, we’re not talking about democracy.
In a general sense, Quadratic Voting is a collective decision-making process that goes beyond a simple yes or no vote, enabling people to choose the intensity of their preferences. And we decided to implement it at hackathons.
Why? Because hackathons result in a wide range of projects, and it can be challenging to determine which projects are the most liked by people. This is where QV comes in, enabling people to vote depending on how much they like a project.”

Taipei Blockchain Week brings together industry experts from all over the world in the blockchain space to educate and empower Taiwan to become a growing hub for web3 innovation.
Taiwan is regarded as the cultural entrance to East Asia. The island sits at a central geographic location and has a history of close ties to China, Japan, ASEAN, and other regions around the world. Diverse historic and cultural influences exist in Taiwan and are reflected on the streets, buildings, food, and religions - from tranquil alleys with Japanese influences that might lead to a bustling Taoist temple around the corner to exquisite French desserts that may feature a twist of Taiwanese local fruits and ingredients.
Taiwan currently ranks as one of the fastest growing economies in the world and also one of the most technologically competitive with a leading semiconductor industry. There are many developer communities in Taiwan including blockchain and web3 focused ones such as Taipei Ethereum Meetup.
Taiwan is also one of the safest places in the world with a very low crime rate. The ICCA ranks Taipei as one of the top conference destinations with many venues and accommodations accessible via public transport. Two major airports connect Taipei to hundreds of destinations around the world."

Problem #1: Movement of People Smart Workforce Mobility is all about using data and smart transit planning to make job access easier, faster, and more reliable. Workers should be able to get where they need to be without wasted time or unnecessary transit hurdles.
This challenge is about finding real solutions that cut commute times, improve access to job centers, and make transit more responsive to demand. Whether it’s predictive analytics optimizing routes, AI driven scheduling that adapts in real time, or better last mile connectivity, the goal is to make commuting seamless and efficient.
Startups that integrate rideshare with public transit or leverage real time data to optimize workforce movement will be key to closing accessibility gaps. The end goal? A system that drives economic growth, gets people to work, and evolves with workforce demands.
Problem #2: Movement of Goods Automated Warehouse and Inventory Management Warehousing and logistics need to move faster, smarter, and with fewer errors. This challenge is about using robotics, IoT sensors, and AI to improve real time tracking and streamline last mile delivery.
Companies need better ways to manage inventory, reduce inefficiencies, and scale operations. Whether it’s robotics handling materials more effectively, AI predicting supply chain needs, or IoT sensors tracking inventory movement, we’re looking for solutions that increase speed and accuracy.
Startups that focus on automation driven warehouse layouts, AI powered predictive maintenance, or autonomous delivery systems will redefine efficiency. The goal is to create warehouses that don’t just store products but actively improve operations, reduce errors, and strengthen supply chains.
Problem #3: Movement of Energy AI Enhanced Manufacturing Processes Manufacturing is evolving fast, and AI is driving the change. This challenge is about using automation, machine learning, and predictive analytics to improve maintenance, energy efficiency, and production workflows.
Keeping machines running at peak efficiency is a must, and AI can help prevent breakdowns before they happen. Solutions that integrate IoT monitoring, automate quality control, or enhance production scheduling will help manufacturers boost efficiency and reduce downtime.
Startups that can cut waste, track energy usage more effectively, and implement AI driven strategies will have a major impact. The goal is to build smarter, leaner, and more resilient manufacturing systems that are ready for the future.
Problem #4: Movement of Data Affordable Real Time Transit Tracking Real time transit updates should be accessible to everyone without massive infrastructure costs. Riders shouldn’t have to deal with outdated, unreliable transit info.
This challenge is looking for scalable solutions such as GPS tracking apps, AI powered arrival predictions, or smarter ways to keep riders informed without expensive system overhauls.
If transit users can get reliable updates, more people will use public transportation, making the system more efficient overall. The goal is simple: make transit easier, faster, and more predictable for everyone."

Token Risk Scoring on Base,"As blockchain ecosystems like Base (an Ethereum Layer 2 solution) grow rapidly, token creation has become increasingly common. However, this growth has also led to malicious tokens designed for fraud—stealing funds, running scams, or exploiting smart contract vulnerabilities. These malicious tokens are digital assets created to deceive users, investors, and network participants through hidden harmful code. Early detection of such tokens is vital for user protection and ecosystem integrity, though this proves challenging due to blockchain's pseudonymous nature and attackers' sophisticated obfuscation tactics. Malicious tokens typically show distinct patterns of suspicious behavior, including unusual transaction flows, concentrated ownership, vulnerable contract code, and irregular token economics. A data-driven approach to analyzing these characteristics is essential for effective detection.
A machine learning system using on-chain transactions and token metadata offers a solution to this challenge. This approach starts by gathering and processing blockchain data to identify signs of malicious activity, particularly focusing on ownership patterns and transaction behaviors. These indicators feed into a predictive model—whether Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Graph Neural Network (GNN)—that learns to distinguish between suspicious and legitimate tokens. Adding anomaly detection capabilities helps catch new, previously unseen attack patterns, creating a comprehensive defense for the network and its users.
If you are unfamiliar with the basic concepts in Crypto such as tokens and wallets, please start with our blog post ""Blockchain 101"". Otherwise, let's dive in!
Note: To qualify for competition points, please upload both your model predictions and your code.

Recommend potential alphas on Base based on transaction history and other on-chain activities. For more information and submit your model, please visit: https://cryptopond.xyz/modelFactory/detail/55
Overview
In blockchain ecosystems, token discovery and selection often play a crucial role for users and investors looking to identify high-value opportunities, such as promising tokens, early-stage projects, or innovations with substantial growth potential. These valuable opportunities, often referred to as ""alphas"" in the crypto community, represent tokens or projects with significant prospects but are not yet widely recognized. Identifying alphas early can lead to considerable financial gains, but it also comes with inherent risks and challenges due to the lack of readily available, trustworthy insights or recommendations.
Base is an Ethereum Layer 2 network developed by Coinbase, designed to provide a secure and cost-effective environment for decentralized applications (dApps) and transactions. Positioned as a scalable and developer-friendly ecosystem, Base has been gaining traction among projects and users. However, with a rapidly growing number of tokens and projects launching daily on Base, it is challenging for users to sift through the noise and spot the true alphas. Without accurate and informed recommendations, users may miss key investment opportunities or fall victim to low-quality or speculative projects.
The challenge is to develop a reliable system for token recommendation on the Base blockchain. Specifically, the goal is to identify and recommend high-potential tokens (""alphas"") on Base while filtering out low-value or risky options. This involves assessing vast volumes of data, such as on-chain activity, to produce actionable insights for individuals seeking promising opportunities on Base.
Addressing this issue is critical for multiple reasons:
User Empowerment: By providing accurate and data-driven token recommendations, users are equipped to make smarter, more informed decisions that align with their financial goals.
Ecosystem Growth: Highlighting high-potential tokens can attract attention to innovative projects, incentivizing adoption, development, and investment within the Base ecosystem.
Time-Efficiency: A recommendation framework saves users from manually analyzing an overwhelming amount of data, making the Base blockchain more accessible even to non-technical participants.
In sum, a reliable token recommendation system can play a transformative role in creating a vibrant and trustworthy ecosystem on Base, supporting both individual users and the broader blockchain community.
If you are unfamiliar with the basic concepts in Crypto such as tokens and wallets, please start with our blog post ""Blockchain 101"". Otherwise, let's dive in!
The online phase of this competition runs for 7 weeks. During this period, you may submit your model results up to 3 times per day. Half of the records in your submission file will be used for initial evaluation, with preliminary scores displayed on the Leaderboard.
At the end of week 7, you must submit your best model result before the submission portal closes. The remaining half of the records in your best submission will be used to determine the final score. The top 10 model developers will be notified and advance to the second round, where they'll present their work to a committee of AI leaders from the competition hosts. If notified, please respond within 48 hours or you lose your spot to the next-ranked developer.
During week 8, these finalists will prepare their presentations and upload their models according to Pond's technical specifications. Presentations occur at the end of week 8, with final rankings determined by both evaluation scores and committee feedback. The top 3 developers will receive their prizes after their models are successfully verified and deployed to Pond Models platform. The prizes are: 1st place will be awarded $4000, 2nd place $2000, and 3rd place $1000. Additionally, revenue from the models’ future usage will be distributed back to their developers proportionally."

Why Game Jams are Awesome
Game jams are a great way to learn new skills, challenge yourself, and most importantly, have fun! Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newcomer, game jams provide a space for creativity, experimentation, and connecting with others who share your passion. Plus, nothing beats the thrill of seeing your creation come to life in such a short time.

We'd love for you to be part of our community! Join our Discord server here to chat with other participants, share progress, ask questions, and communicate with the organizers. It's also where we'll be sharing important updates during the jam, so make sure to hop in!
Theme
The theme for the game jam will be decided by a community vote! We’ll provide a link where you can cast your vote, and the winning theme will be revealed when the jam starts. Get ready to see how everyone interprets the same idea in different ways!
Rules
The main rule is simple: your game must not include any NSFW, offensive, or discriminatory content. We want the games to be fun and enjoyable for everyone!
Other than that:
You can use any game engine or framework you like. You must utilize Whalepass.gg to create a rewarding experience for your players via the API or unity SDK. You must utilize the rewards specifically on moonbeam. This integration is required for promoting your game on the Discover.games website. Extra points will be granted for submissions that make excellent use of Whalepass features and capabilities, and extra points for games that can run in web.
You’re allowed to use assets not made by you, as long as you have the proper licenses and give credit where it’s due. Making everything from scratch is awesome, but not required! Teaming up is allowed and encouraged! We recommend teams of up to 4 people for smoother coordination over the weekend.
What is Whalepass?
Whalepass is a game backend platform that allows developers to add rewards to their games, such as skins, boosters, or any assets they wish. With Whalepass integration, players can use, trade, and own these assets securely, as they are hosted on Moonbeam, and other networks, providing true asset ownership and a more engaging gaming experience. An example of Whalepass integration is showcased in ""Where Dreams Take Flight,"" which won first place in our previous game jam. You can view the game here for inspiration on how Whalepass can enhance gameplay.

--> you can work individually, or form teams and work together
--> you can help each other in the help channel
Create a DoraHacks Account and Register for the Hackathon
(check the Hackers tab to see who has registered)
You can work on Qiskit Challenge notebooks (see the QiskitChallenges tab above):
by uploading the notebook to Google Colab (easiest way to get started)
or by creating a conda environment and running the notebook locally
you can find links to Qiskit resources in the notebooks and here
Submit your work for the Qiskit Challenges, ScavengerHunts, and/or BusinessChallenge via:
a BUIDL (by Nov. 25, start of day PT (Seattle), this is the DoraHacks end of event time)

Creating a BUIDL is pretty easy. There are a few steps, and some required * fields at each step.

To make it possibly faster, or clearer, here are some suggestions for values for some of those fields.
project name: anything you like, possibly Qiskit Fall Fest 2024
project logo: any PNG or JPEG < 2MB will work
project vision: anything is ok, possibly Learning about Qiskit v1.0+, Quantum Computing, and/or Solving a Business Problem

Ideahacker's Guide to IBC,"🚀 Ideahacker’s Guide to IBC: An Interchain Ideathon
The IBC Ideathon is an opportunity for creative and inventive blockchain builders and users to pioneer the next generation of cross-chain innovation. It’s a hackathon just for ideas. No coding or software engineering required.
The best ideas will win an all-expenses-paid trip to Istanbul and part of the $30,000 prize pool.
🙋 Who is the Ideathon for? Anyone with a fundamental knowledge of how blockchains work is welcome to join the Ideathon. While developers are welcome, participants do not need to be one to join.
🏆 Prizes and Tracks
The best ideas will win an all-expenses-paid trip to Istanbul and part of the $30,000 prize pool in ATOM tokens. Each of the 5 tracks will have 5 prize winners:
$3,000 first place
$1,500 second place
3 third place winners at $500 each
For a detailed breakdown, visit the Prizes and Tracks tab.
🛠️ How Ideahacker’s Guide to IBC Works
The IBC Ideathon is a global, online competition designed to push the boundaries of cross-chain innovation using the world's largest and most widely adopted blockchain interoperability protocol, the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC).
The Ideathon is intended as an accessible event for developers and non-technical builders to explore the IBC protocol’s capabilities.
The difference between the IBC Ideathon and a traditional hackathon is that Ideathon participation takes much less time and energy than participating in a hackathon. Ideathon participants submit an idea rather than a Github code base or proof-of-concept product.
This being said, the winning ideas must be high-quality and genuinely innovative.
Participating is a simple process:
Register as a hacker on Dorahacks.
Use the IBC Idea Builder to visually map out your IBC idea.
Export the JSON link for your IBC Idea. Add the link to your Dorahacks BUIDL.
Add a write-up to your BUIDL.
Submit your BUIDL on Dorahacks.
Make sure to read the eligibility criteria and idea submission instructions. Only high-quality, well-thought-out ideas will be eligible to win prizes.
🦾 Why IBC?
IBC is one of the most widely-adopted interoperability protocols in the world. Over 115 chains are IBC-enabled, and the protocol processes billions of dollars in asset transfers every 30 days.
IBC enables secure, permissionless, feature-rich cross-chain interactions, like token transfers and general message-passing. Unlike a token bridge contract that sits ""on top of"" a chain, IBC-enabled chains exchange data without a third-party intermediary.
IBC has several industry-leading features and functionalities beyond basic token transfers. Unique IBC features include:
Interchain Accounts and Queries - Cross-chain account control and data queries.
Cross-chain callbacks - Smart contracts and modules can be natively cross-chain enabled for adaptable workflows leveraging multiple smart contracts and applications.
NFT transfers - Send and receive cross-chain NFT transfers.
Cross-chain validation - A provider chain provides economic security to a consumer chain(s), so the consumer chains do not have to run their own validator sets.
No in-protocol fees - The IBC Protocol does not charge fees for processing transactions. Users are only responsible for gas fees for the transactions they process.

HackSecret 4,"Overview
Secret Network enables developers to build decentralized applications with encrypted data, both natively on Secret and on other blockchains through cross-chain communication, unlocking powerful new use-cases for Web3. This is known as Decentralized Confidential Computing, or DeCC.
HackSecret 4 is an opportunity to build cutting-edge Web3 applications for the Cosmos, EVM, or Solana, utilizing Secret Network's decentralized confidential computing (DeCC) capabilities. If you are a developer from another ecosystem who has never worked with Secret contracts before, have no fear! Our developer toolkits will teach you everything you need to know to get started and win prizes.
Confidential computing unlocks exciting new use-cases, and Secret Network's Confidential Computing Layer enables developers to do this while building on nearly any blockchain! This hackathon includes two tracks, one for cross-chain applications (IBC, EVM, or Solana), and one for native Secret applications. The choice is yours!
If you have questions, you can contact the Secret Network team, or join the Secret Network Developer Telegram or Discord. Also, be sure to check out our HackSecret 4 event schedule, which includes workshops and open discussion sessions.

About Balancer and V3
Three years ago, we launched Balancer v2, a permissionless DeFi infrastructure to empower Automated Market Maker (AMM) innovation. While v2’s versatility has been a success, its unopinionated architecture has resulted in complex custom pools that inconsistently reimplement core design patterns, posing challenges for developers, integrators, and off-chain tooling.
Balancer v3’s architecture focuses on simplicity, flexibility, and extensibility at its core. The v3 vault more formally defines the requirements of a custom pool, allowing us to shift core design patterns out of the pool and into the vault. Additionally, we’ve implemented a “transient accounting” system leveraging EIP-1153, re-entrant pool lifecycle hooks to enable unprecedented flexibility, native support for yield-bearing tokens, 100% boosted pools, and a flexible router design pattern to facilitate complex interactions with the Balancer protocol.
As v3 approaches feature completion, we are releasing the codebase to allow the broader ecosystem to provide feedback and make contributions before the code is frozen for audits. You can find the current state of Balancer v3 here, and the accompanying documentation here. As in v2, the v3 codebase will be licensed under GPL 3.0, reinforcing our dedication to transparency, collaboration, and the open-source community."

v4 Hookathon: PancakeSwap x Brevis Hackathon,"⚒️v4 Hookathon Overview
Following the launch of our PancakeSwap v4 whitepaper in March 2024, we’ve been actively inviting developers to contribute on PancakeSwap v4 through various hackathons like ETHGlobal Brussels and the ETHGlobal London Hackathon. Now, with the v4 launch on the horizon at the end of 2024, we're thrilled to introduce the first-ever v4 Hookathon, hosted by PancakeSwap and Brevis, as part of our $500K Developer Program. With a prize pool of $40,000, this hackathon offers a unique opportunity to innovate and build within the PancakeSwap v4 ecosystem. Utilize the Brevis ZK-Coprocessor to develop cutting-edge Hooks and prepare to showcase your work as we gear up for the v4 launch!
🎯Purpose of the Hackathon
The v4 Hookathon aims to push the boundaries of what's possible on PancakeSwap v4 by developing groundbreaking Hooks that enhance functionality and address existing challenges. Participants will leverage the Brevis ZK-Coprocessor to create solutions that are innovative, technically robust, and user-friendly.
🤔Why Build on PancakeSwap v4 with the Brevis ZK-Coprocessor?
Brevis is a smart ZK coprocessor that brings advanced capabilities to smart contracts, enabling them to access and analyze comprehensive historical on-chain data from any blockchain. It also allows for customizable computations, all while ensuring complete trustlessness.
PancakeSwap v4 supports Hooks, which are external smart contracts that can be integrated with any liquidity pool to provide customized functionality. Hooks can execute predefined logic before or after key actions such as initialization, swaps, position modifications, and donations. This allows for a new level of customization within liquidity pools, enabling features like dynamic fees, active liquidity management, impermanent loss mitigation, and more.
Brevis-powered Hooks further extend these capabilities by allowing the querying of historical data and the execution of operations in a trustless manner. This enables advanced use cases such as loyalty programs, exclusive user access, incentivization schemes, and more. Additionally, the ability to protect intellectual property while maintaining trustlessness supports use cases like liquidity management, asset management, and beyond.
🏆Hackathon Open Track
Open Track ($40,000 Prize Pool): We are keeping it simple with a single open track to encourage diverse and creative solutions. We welcome ideas that address any existing pain points within the PancakeSwap ecosystem.
Potential Ideas:
Liquidity Incentivisation: Develop mechanisms to incentivize liquidity providers (LPs) based on:
Utility-based: Reward LPs for contributions during volatile periods or low liquidity.
Time-based: Reward proportional to the duration of liquidity provision.
Amount-based: Higher rewards for consistent large liquidity contributions.
Milestone-based: Incentives for maintaining liquidity over consecutive days.
Cross-Platform: Rewards for liquidity provision across integrated platforms.
Boosted Rewards for Lockup: Incentives proportional to the duration of liquidity lockup.
Active Liquidity Manager: Create a hook for managing liquidity with configurable strategies, allowing protocols to adapt their liquidity management dynamically while protecting the intellectual property of their algorithms.
Market-Making Bot: Design a market-making bot for managing LP liquidity and sharing yields, suitable for LBAMM pool types (works similar to an order book model).
Exclusive-Access Pools: Develop pools accessible only to users who meet specific criteria, such as holding an OG NFT or reaching a transaction milestone.
KYC-Enabled/Permissioned Institutional Pools: Implement identity verification mechanisms that maintain privacy while ensuring compliance.
Yield Manager: Create a yield management solution that leverages the zk-Coprocessor for off-chain computation while maintaining on-chain transparency, optimizing idle liquidity to maximize yield.
Loyalty Privileges: Grant fee discounts or additional rewards to veCAKE holders based on certain holding pattern
Prize Distribution
🥇 1st Prize: $12,000
🥈 2nd Prize: $10,000
🥉 3rd Prize: $8,000
🏅 4th Prize: $6,000
🏅 5th Prize: $4,000
Please note: Prizes are awarded only if entries meet the judging and eligibility criteria. Entries that do not meet the required standards may result in reduced prizes or no prize awarded.
Prize Distribution: Winning prizes will be distributed as USDC on the BNB Chain to the winners' wallet addresses within 4 weeks of the completion of the hackathon.

Automate Injective Yield Strategies Challenge | Injective Bounty,"This is NOT a hackathon; it is the Injective developer bounty challenges. The final prize pool is still pending ($10,000 here is a temporary placeholder).
Please read ""Requirements"", ""Potential Strategies"" and ""Implementation Options"" below to learn about the expected deliverables.
Overview
The Injective ecosystem continues to grow its DeFi footprint. We want to create a product that will showcase yield strategies and optionally execute them on behalf of users, this product will achieve three goals:
Automatically rebalance liquidity in protocols to attain the maximum yield, users will not have to constantly monitor returns and manually rebalance.
Liquidity will be distributed across the ecosystem which will overall reduce risk and improve decentralization.
Reduce the barrier to entry for those not familiar with DeFi protocols and high-yield strategies.
Requirements
Before working on the challenges and coding, please submit a basic idea including which strategy and which implementation option you're going to choose. Only vetted proposals will be approved to continue working on the challenges and potentially get rewards.
Your works for the challenges will be reviewed on a regular basis based on the milestones.
Before receiving the rewards, all the winner candidates should complete KYC/KYB process.
Potential Strategies
1. Strategy A
1.1 Deposit INJ into Hydro and receive hINJ.
1.2 Deposit hINJ into Neptune as collateral.
1.3 Borrow assets and execute other strategies (e.g. borrow INJ and deposit more into Hydro, borrow USDT and lend it to Neptune to earn token incentives, borrow INJ and short INJ perps to achieve delta-neutral exposure while earning token incentives).
Receive staking rewards while earning token incentives from Neptune.
2. Strategy B
1.1 Deposit INJ into Hydro and receive hINJ.
1.2 Deposit hINJ into Injera to mint USDi.
1.3 Deposit USDi-USDT in a Mito vault.
Receive staking rewards while earning token incentives from Injera. The user can optionally provide liquidity in the USDi-USDT (50-50%) Mito vault for additional incentives.
3. Strategy C
1.1 Deposit INJ into a money market (e.g. Neptune).
1.2 Deposit INJ-nept into Injera to mint USDi.
1.3 Deposit USDi-USDT in a Mito vault.
Stake your INJ tokens with no lock-up while earning token incentives and lending yield for both Neptune and Injera. The user can optionally provide liquidity in the USDi-USDT (50-50%) Mito vault for additional incentives.
4. Strategy D
2.1 Looping strategy into money markets such as Neptune and Injera.
Lend and borrow continuously to earn the project’s incentives.
5. Strategy E
2.1 Deposit any asset as collateral in a money market.
2.2 Borrow INJ.
2.3. Short INJ on Helix
Achieve delta-neutral exposure while earning rewards from the money market.
6. Strategy F
2.1 Deposit any asset as collateral on Injera.
2.2 Borrow INJ from Injera at 1% APY.
2.3 Lend INJ on Neptune at 17% APY.
Continuously rebalance lending assets across both money markets for maximum returns.
Implementation
Option A
By leveraging authz, we can allow the users to engage with these strategies in a fully non-custodial fashion and no smart contract risk. However, the users will grant permissions to an address that could be compromised. Note that the authz permissions would be contained to specific contracts though.
Option B
Opposed to leveraging authz, the funds could be deposited in a smart contract so the risk will be limited to the funds deposited.
Option C
The product could also be developed with a hybrid model. The user would delegate authz permissions to a smart contract and the contract would then execute the actions on behalf of the user. The contract admin would be a secure multisig to control upgradeability.
Evaluate all options and propose your solution.
Create a FE that will showcase “Vaults” or “Strategies” and allow the user to subscribe in each.
Create a bot that will execute these actions on behalf of the users (you can potentially integrate Warp to achieve this).
The “Vaults” should show average APY returns but depending on the subscribed balance, we should adjust the actual APY. For example, if somebody deposits 30K INJ into Neptune, the lending yield will drop significantly.
The FE should show the total APY for a user as well as a breakdown for each protocol upon subscription.
Note that we should continuously rebalance funds between protocols in each strategy to avoid liquidations."

The Research Gap
Current students engaged in applied research often find themselves in a loop of grant funding, leading them to focus on continuous research rather than partnering with entrepreneurs to build scalable businesses. There is a disconnect between these applied researchers and the entrepreneurs who can cofound startups and develop a route to market. The proposed solution aims to make it easier for applied research students to connect with entrepreneurs, enabling them to turn their ideas into viable business models and create real-world impact.
Addressing the Research Gap
The platform aims to facilitate the formation of teams between researchers and entrepreneurs at the early stage of research projects. This allows for research to be conducted with the aim of transforming the IP generated into a business. Through this collaboration we expect to see the emergence of more start-ups backed by research, with diverse founding teams containing technical and business skills.
The Funding Gap
Pre-seed Challenges: Pre-seed funds typically require traction and working MVPs, which can be a significant hurdle for early-stage projects.
Larger Fund Hesitancy: Larger funds are hesitant to deploy secondary capital into early-stage funds, as they are not directly linked to the projects. They prefer to invest in companies that directly support their larger investments.
Early-stage Investment Limitations: Funds that invest in early rounds are often smaller and limited to specific investment brackets, such as a minimum of $50,000.
Angel Investment Obstacles: Angels receive deal flow, but the number of investments they can participate in is extremely limited, creating a bottleneck in the funding process.
Addressing the Funding Gap
The platform aims to create seamless dealflow to angel investors and early-stage VCs. The start-ups that come through the platform are backed by research and own their IP, creating more traction. Integrating alumni networks allows for an additional layer of trust between the start-up and angel investor.
Alumni Networks
Alumni networks are well-established across leading universities worldwide, providing mentorship and funding support to fellow graduates who are starting a business. These networks allow for an initial level of trust to be created between angel investors and early-stage projects, as they have a common educational background. The proposed platform would integrate an alumni network element to enhance the connection between startups and angel investors, leveraging this existing trust and support system.
Participants
Ideal teams will consist of both developers and business minded individuals.
Prizes
A prize pool of R5 000 will be shared amongst the top 3 teams.
1st: R3500
2nd: R1000
3rd: R500
IP ownership
The IP generated during the hackathon will be made public once the hackathon is complete.
Duration
The hackathon will be held over a period of 2 weeks.

✅ How to submit your project
Submission Requirements:
All submissions need to deploy to Holesky Testnet and include the following:
Incorporate unique use cases or implementation
A 5-minute demo illustrating the project in comprehensive detail
Links to your code repository, website and socials to help judges review your submission. If the participant's website is private, the project must include login credentials in its testing instructions.
In the README: detail why your team went with the approaches they did
In the README: experience building on Othentic
Multiple Submissions:
Entrants are allowed to submit more than one submission. However, each submission must be unique and substantially different from the others.
Submission Materials:
All submission materials must be in English, including the demonstration video, text description, and testing instructions, as well as any other materials submitted.
Disclosure:
Projects submitted to other hackathons or challenges need to be disclosed in the submission or README of the project.
The judging panel will evaluate project submissions based on how the team implements their features and the uniqueness of the application.
📄 Rules
Don’t start coding your project before the hackathon officially starts. You can obviously start researching or learning how to use the Othentic Stack, but you must not start coding the project you intend to submit.
If you want to use pre-existing code (e.g. from a prior project you’ve made) you must notify us first in writing, with a detailed explanation of which parts you’ll be re-using. You are, of course, allowed to fork projects (rather than reinventing the wheel). However, your hackathon submission will be judged solely on the merits of what you have achieved during the time of the hackathon itself. If during or after the event, we find that you failed to disclose that you used a pre-existing code, you will be subject to disqualification.
Your project must remain open source and available on the Github repo you submit.

Resources
Fraxtal
Fraxtal is a modular rollup by Frax Finance with fractal scaling tech. Fraxtal is part of the OP Superchain. Fraxtal is fully EVM compatible & has all of the dev tooling all blockchain engineers are familiar with in the EVM and L2 world. Fraxtal’s modular DA component allows for near-zero transaction fees making it consistently one of, if not the cheapest, rollups to use, deploy, and build on.
Fraxtal is home of the Frax Finance ecosystem where all Frax Assets are natively issued, yield opportunities are plentiful, and the ideal and easiest place for DeFi devs to build deep liquidity & TVL. Essentially, Fraxtal is home to the Frax Decentralized Central Bank where partner applications can leverage endogenous yield, benefit from Frax protocol owned liquidity in their dapps, and take advantage of near-zero transaction fees for their applications. Fraxtal also has a unique FXTL point distribution system that awards popular smart contracts in near real-time called the Flox system. Any time users interact with a smart contract, that contract’s rank increases and it earns FXTL points based on the all time interactions and ranking of that contract. This makes Fraxtal one of the most lucrative places to deploy smart contracts to.

HackSecret 3,"Overview
Secret Network enables developers to build decentralized applications with encrypted data, both natively on Secret and on other blockchains through cross-chain communication, unlocking powerful new use-cases for Web3. This is known as Decentralized Confidential Computing, or DeCC.
**
HackSecret III is an opportunity to build cutting-edge Web3 applications, utilizing Secret Network's decentralized confidential computing (DeCC) capabilities. Confidential computing unlocks exciting new use-cases, and Secret Network's Confidential Computing Layer enables developers to do this while building on nearly any blockchain! This hackathon includes two tracks, one for cross-chain applications, and one for native Secret applications. The choice is yours!
Schedule
All workshops will take place on Secret Network's Discord:
May 20th 2024, 16:00 UTC: Kickoff Call, Hackathon Begins!
May 23rd 2024, 16:00 UTC: SecretPath + WalletConnect Workshop on EVM

Tracks
Cross-Chain dApps For dApps that use cross-chain communication to access Secret for confidential computing. Developers building on EVM and IBC chains can execute smart contracts on Secret and vice versa. This means complete composability across Web3.
Example: A dApp that stores encrypted data on Polygon and decrypts with Secret smart contracts (see developer resources below for examples).
Native Secret dApp For dApps built natively on Secret Network. Secret's privacy-by-default design is essential to the security and adoption of the decentralized web. User-side privacy not only enables novel use cases but also puts users back in charge of their sensitive data.
Example: a messaging dApp built exclusively using Secret smart contracts
Developers can submit to multiple tracks if applicable :D
Prize Distribution
Total Pool: $8,000 USD
$5,000 USD is reserved for the Cross-Chain dApp track, and $3,000 USD is reserved for the Native Secret dApp track.
Secret Network and its affiliates reserve the right to withhold prizes at their discretion if submissions do not meet the competition's standards.

dAGI House – AI x Web3 Hackathon,"Introduction
AGI is coming.
It will augment human capabilities in numerous economically significant tasks, increasing productivity, accelerating innovation, and uplifting living standards.
No single organization has the resources to build it today. And even if they did, it would lead to centralized control, manipulation, bias, and censorship.
AI is becoming increasingly useful in a variety of tasks, enhancing and amplifying human intelligence.
A network of autonomous agents, specialized models, and infrastructure will progressively lead to AGI.
Our goal is to explore the design space for AI applications, agents, and protocols, and to ensure that it will be equally accessible to everyone, unbiased, and personalized. Thus, slowly building decentralized AGI.

Tracks
DeFi
DeFi is due for a makeover. In this track you’re building anything related to DeFi. As a suggestion, we challenge you to build a project that makes DeFi accessible to a mass audience, especially those who are new to web3 and non-technical. Some ideas include, but not limited to:
Decentralized Options AMM with deep liquidity and innovative incentives
Perps DEXs with superior UX thanks to account abstraction smart wallets (social login)
Decentralized exchanges with enhanced features (Uniswap hooks, other ideas)
Yield farming platforms with ZK-proofs for secure yield calculations
Just something nerdy, build with cool tech and might not even be useful
Gaming
Games built on-chain are now possible with vanilla Solidity or Solidity-based game engines. Game development is no joke, and you don’t have to spend your time building a full-scale game. Your goal is to showcase the unique benefits that blockchain and ZK offer to the world of gaming in innovative and creative ways. Some ideas include:
On-chain games with provably fair reward distribution and verifiable randomness/verifiable computation
On-chain games with privacy-enriched gameplay (eg. private attributes on a character that will only be revealed after battle. eg games like Dark Forest)
Games powered by ZK-proofs
Or just a simple card game where you embarrass your friends
Here are some examples of games built at a hackathon:

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/shadow-warfare-gxvty
Privacy
ZK allows for a new level of privacy, and we encourage you to think of innovative use cases that emphasize the unique benefits that zero-knowledge unlocks. Some ideas include, but not limited to:
Privacy-preserving identity and credential management systems
Anonymous voting and governance platforms
Private data sharing and computation protocols
Privacy-enhancing communication and messaging applications
Privacy-focused decentralized storage and cloud computing solutions
General
Surprise us. If you have a cool idea and you don’t think it fits in any of the above tracks. Build it anyhow. The sky's the limit!

Transform any Ethereum application into a plug-and-play solution on Bitcoin!
In a brand new paper, Jameson Lopp reviewed the Botanix Labs whitepaper and noted its simplicity. He wrote, “While there are a variety of proposals being discussed for enhancing Bitcoin's Layer 2 capabilities […] one distinction with Botanix's Spiderchain is that it can be implemented on Bitcoin today without any protocol changes to the base layer.”
With SpiderHack, the Botanix team wants to give developers:
Practical experience with an EVM-equivalent layer on Bitcoin
Education on how the future of Bitcoin L2s can function
Opportunities to compete for a $50,000 bounty
Relationships with the Botanix team and ecosystem to build on Bitcoin

Tracks
Cross-Chain Privacy For dApps that implement cross-chain privacy using Secret Smart contracts. Secret contracts are fully executable on EVM chains through the use of General Message Passing (GMP). Developers building on Ethereum can execute smart contracts on Secret and vice versa. This means complete composability across Web3.
Example: A dApp that stores encrypted data on Polygon and decrypts with Secret smart contracts (see developer resources below for examples).
Native Secret dApp For dApps built natively on Secret Network. Secret's privacy-by-default design is essential to the security and adoption of the decentralized web. User-side privacy not only enables novel use cases but also puts users back in charge of their sensitive data.
Example: a messaging dApp built exclusively using Secret smart contracts
Prize Distribution
Total Pool: $15,000 USD
Secret Labs & Secret Network Foundation: $8,000 USD
$5,000USD is reserved for the Cross-Chain Privacy track, and $3,000USD is reserved for the native Secret dApp track.
Shade Protocol (for projects that use Shade.js): $5,000 USD
Secret Africa (for projects with African team members): $2,000 USD
Secret Network and its affiliates reserve the right to withhold prizes at their discretion if submissions do not meet the competition's standards.
Requirements for Submission
You should submit your BUIDL via DoraHacks.io.
Submission Expectation:
Documentation: Provide clear and concise documentation of your projects. This should include setup instructions, usage guidelines, and any additional information that helps judges and other developers understand the project.
Demo or Video: Create a demo or video showcasing your project's functionality. Videos are particularly helpful in conveying the project's value and can be easily shared and understood by judges and the public. Preferably contracts have a usable UI/Mockup to be shown.
Open Source: Make projects open source. This fosters collaboration, allows others to learn from your code, and contributes to the broader developer community. The full code of your back and frontend should be submitted under a (restrictive/permissive) open source license.
Written Description: Include a README.md in your github repository (max 2 pages) that includes a ""User focused summary"" (talk about what it does), an ""Investor pitch"" (What is the problem it solves and where is the product market fit?), and a ""Development Deepdive"" (How did you build this, how do the contracts/functions interact and which design choices did you make).
Shade Track: Projects must make use of Shade.js. See developer resources below for documentation.
Secret Africa Track: Projects must include an African team member. See Discord link below to connect with team members from Secret Africa.

Avalanche Frontier: Decentralized Consumer Application Hackathon,"Introduction
We're thrilled to introduce the Avalanche Frontier: Decentralized Consumer Application Hackathon co-hosted by Dora Hacks and Particle Network.
This hackathon will be a month-long virtual event in January and February. We welcome builders from around the world to embark on their Avalanche journey by developing the next generation of consumer facing applications.
Web2 consumer applications today are broken. Across social media platforms and digital marketplaces, users are offering their time and data essentially for free to centralized entities to profit. We believe that the next wave of apps will be built on decentralized blockchain rails.
Have you ever wanted to launch your own SocialFi app where creators and users are rewarded for their engagement? Have you thought about building the next Uber or Airbnb where the users have the most to benefit? What about a wireless network where users can also contribute their bandwidth? If so, this event is the perfect opportunity whether you're getting an idea off the ground to MVP or looking to scale up your skillset as a more experienced builder. We encourage you to think outside of the box and always build with the end consumer in mind.
Throughout the event, builders will also have access to a wide range of tools and services offered by our partners and sponsors along with different tracks to compete for prizes:
Particle Network (https://particle.network) is the Intent-Centric, Modular Access Layer of Web3. Particle offers various UX-focused SDKs and APIs, which together enable social logins and dApp-embedded wallets, as well as account abstraction. This toolkit constitutes Particle's flagship product, Modular Smart Wallet-as-a-Service, and covers over fifty blockchains and most mobile or desktop platforms. With various additional products on the horizon, such as Particle Network's Intent Fusion Protocol, Omnichain AA, Confidential zkStack, and the first AA protocol on Bitcoin, BTC Connect, Particle aims to provide the infrastructure for a mass-market-ready industry.
Chainlink (https://chain.link/) is the industry-standard Web3 services platform. It has enabled trillions of dollars in transaction volume across DeFi, onchain finance, gaming, NFTs, and other major industries. As the leading decentralized oracle network, Chainlink empowers developers to build feature-rich Web3 applications with seamless access to real-world data, offchain computation, and cross-chain interoperability across any blockchain, providing global enterprises with a universal gateway to all blockchains.
Covalent (https://www.covalenthq.com/) is the industry-leading multichain indexer with over 200 blockchains and over 30 Avalanche Subnets indexed, making us the top data service provider in the Avalanche ecosystem. Our flagship Unified API brings visibility to billions of data points for developers building multichain applications.
Movement Labs (https://movementlabs.xyz/) is a network of Move-based blockchains designed to pair smart contract security and parallelization with EVM liquidity and user bases. The first major release from Movement is M1, a modular layer one blockchain. M1 is built to support a diverse ecosystem, including liquidity sources and EVM-compatible tooling, all under the Snowman consensus mechanism. Validators on M1 will play a crucial role in a decentralized sequencing network, paving the way for the development of the Movement L2 Client. Powered by the Move Stack, M2 is the first MEVM (Move + EVM) ZK L2 on Ethereum powered by Celestia, natively bringing the Move Virtual Machine to Ethereum. The Move Stack also enables teams to launch their custom Move rollups and connect to the decentralized sequencer network which enables atomic composability between next-generation rollups.
Paladin (https://paladinsec.co) is a leading smart contract auditing company with an essential focus on decentralized finance protocols. We work mainly with EVM-compatible protocols to help increase the security of their contracts.
Hackers of all experience levels and projects of any stage are welcome to participate. Beyond the competition, we hope you meet like-minded builders and have a great time!
Tracks and Prize Pools
A prize pool of over $100,000 will be distributed to winners according to the submission requirements and judging criteria listed below. Projects will be eligible for consideration in both Grand Prize pool as well as the different partner tracks as long as the submissions meet the criteria for each track.
Grand Prize - $75,000 total
1st: $45,000
2nd: $20,000
3rd: $10,000
To be eligible for the Grand Prizes, project submissions must implement Particle Auth and/or Particle Connect in their submission. If used, the application should either have:
A direct social login button facilitating sign in with Google, Twitter, email, etc. (via Particle Auth, as is shown within this demo).
A generalized connection modal which includes social login options (via Particle Connect, as is shown within this demo).
Other wallets can be and are encouraged to be implemented within the submission. However, Particle should be the only mechanism facilitating social login as one of those options.
This is a free-to-use SDK and, through Web3.js or ethers, can be implemented in any standard application flow; it's meant to act as the access point for users, upon which an account is generated and used through either a standard EIP-1193 provider or directly through Particle’s SDKs.

Nolus Beyond Ideathon X DoraHacks - Open for trust-minimized cross-chain solution BUIDLers,"Introduction
From 25.06.2024 to 31.12.2024 the Nolus Beyond ideathon is open for global application with $10,000 in prizes!
Beyond is an ideathon hosted by DoraHacks, the world’s largest multi-chain developer incentive platform, and Nolus - an application-specific blockchain network with a new type of lending market solution on top built with the Cosmos SDK and CosmWASM, and utilizing the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) plus the Interchain Accounts (ICA) protocols for real-time cross-chain communication with other IBC- and ICA-enabled blockchain networks.
During the 97 days of running, participants will get fully familiar with the current architecture of the Nolus network and build concepts around creating a trust-minimized communication structure with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain networks.
The goal of this Beyond ideathon is to establish an applicable concept for trust-minimized interoperability between a CosmWASM-based chain such as Nolus and an arbitrary EVM-compatible chain (e.g. Arbitrum, Avalanche C-chain, Optimism, Ethereum, etc.). Ideally, this communication protocol should be reusable across different EVM networks. The goal is to have a smart contract on the Nolus chain perform actions on a foreign EVM chain through cross-chain messages.
For now, Nolus can do this with other Cosmos chains such as Osmosis and Neutron via the IBC protocol but the end goal is to scale to other networks beyond Cosmos. Ideally, the same type of communication is to be applied to EVM chains as well. This means a user should be able to open a lease (borrow) position where the Nolus protocol would utilize a decentralized exchange deployed on an EVM chain (e.g. Trader Joe on the Avalanche C-chain or Camelot on Arbitrum) to facilitate the swapping of the deposit provided by the borrower and the loan provided by Nolus to the desired asset by the borrower. This position should be controlled by a Nolus lease (borrow) smart contract. Examples of actions which should be controlled by a specific lease contract:
The contract must be able to liquidate the asset should its price drop enough to reach the liquidation threshold;
The borrower needs to be able to claim the asset from the account on the integrated EVM network if the debt is repaid to Nolus;
Should the borrower want to repay the debt with the assets in the position, they should be able to send a corresponding command to the Lease contract which in turn would swap the assets on the integrated EVM exchange and return the debt to Nolus and the excess assets to the borrower.
Tasks
Task 1. Read about the current architecture of Nolus. Create an initial concept showcasing the most crucial components of the appchain, and their interaction with one another and other IBC-enabled Cosmos chains.
Task 2. Explore existing technologies for cross-chain communication that support messaging between EVM-based and Cosmos chains. Outline prerequisites, potential challenges (e.g. Nolus is a semi-permissioned appchain), and steps for integration.
Task 3. Extend the concept generated with Task 1 to include the new communication standard described in Task 2. Make sure to describe every interaction between a component from the existing Nolus architecture and a newly added part.
Integrated Task Requirements for Nolus Appchain Development Ideathon Application: Objective: Develop a comprehensive understanding of the Nolus appchain’s current architecture and explore innovative solutions for integrating cross-chain communication capabilities between Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based and Cosmos chains. Extend the existing architecture by incorporating these new technologies and standards. Deliverables for Combined Tasks:
Architecture Overview:
Diagram: Create an initial detailed diagram of the Nolus appchain, highlighting the crucial components and their interactions within the appchain as well as with other IBC-enabled Cosmos chains.
Description: Provide a written explanation of each component, detailing its role and interactions within the network.
Cross-Chain Communication Analysis:
Technology Research: Research and document existing technologies that enable messaging and communication between EVM-based and Cosmos chains, with an emphasis on compatibility with semi-permissioned appchains like Nolus.
Integration Challenges: Identify and analyze potential challenges in integrating these technologies, considering Nolus’s specific requirements and semi-permissioned nature. Propose possible solutions to these challenges.
Integration Steps: Outline a clear step-by-step plan for integrating the chosen cross-chain communication technology into the Nolus architecture.
Extended Architecture Development:
Updated Diagram: Update the initial architecture diagram to include the new cross-chain communication standard, showing how it integrates with the existing components.
Interaction Description: Describe in detail every interaction between the original components and the newly added parts of the architecture. Highlight how these enhancements will improve the appchain’s functionality and performance.

About Nolus
The Nolus Protocol defines a money market between lenders looking to yield on stablecoins and borrowers looking to amplify their holdings. For borrowers, the Nolus DeFi Lease provides up to 150% financing on the initial investment with a lowered margin call risk and access to the underlying leveraged assets through whitelisted strategies.
The protocol utilizes an application-specific blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK and a WASM smart contract engine focusing on interoperability, security, and performance. Interoperability, in particular, is at the core of Nolus’ offering as the Protocol utilizes IBC and Interchain Accounts to tap into a diverse set of liquidity hubs without creating fragmentation across chains. Each DeFi Lease position is a separate smart contract instance on the Nolus chain that registers an Interchain Account on a host network and facilitates swapping via an integrated exchange where the assets in the lease position are kept in the Interchain Account.

About LightLink
LightLink is an Ethereum L2 blockchain that enables dApps and enterprises to offer fast, gasless transactions for their users.
Since 2018, we've been developing blockchain solutions for major enterprises in the APAC region. Recognizing the need for broader interoperability, we shifted our focus to building an optimistic rollup on our proprietary stack, aiming to bridge dApps with millions of users from our enterprise partners and foster an interconnected economy.
'tx.gasPrice = 0': A key feature of LightLink is its Enterprise Mode, which enables the creation of a gas station to nullify transaction fees for users over a set period, allowing the development of unique protocols that only our gasless ecosystem can support. This includes range order books, no-slippage perpetual DEXs, SocialFi, GameFi, and other products that demand high computational power.
With LightLink in its early stages, developers have the opportunity to join an ecosystem where liquidity and the user base aren't yet dominated by major projects, and they can benefit from zero gas fees while still connecting to the broader Ethereum ecosystem. By leveraging gasless transactions and the latest Web3 UX trends, builders have the potential to create dApps with Web3 capabilities and a Web2 user experience, achieving what was previously thought impossible just a year ago."

About the Hackathon
For this hackathon, we're thrilled to introduce you to opBNB and Greenfield, two cutting-edge blockchain platforms that offer endless possibilities for developers and entrepreneurs.
BNB Greenfield provides decentralized storage infrastructure within the broader BNB Chain ecosystem. The idea is to help users and dApps to create, store, and exchange data with full ownership, and form a new data economy.
The opBNB network is the Layer 2 scaling solution for the BNB Smart Chain, powered by the bedrock version of Optimism OP Stack. It allows users to deposit and withdraw funds, use smart contracts, and view network data with high throughput and low fees, all while scaling beyond the constraints of the BNB Smart Chain.
Hackathon Requirements
We encourage you to develop in line with our Wishlist, which includes exciting tracks in both Greenfield and opBNB. Each track offers exciting challenges and opportunities for innovation. You can view the details list at the bottom of this announcement.
Rewards
We're offering up to $100k in rewards for your hard work and innovation:
1st Prize: $15k
2nd Prize: $10k
3rd Prize: $5k
Plus, up to 70k in addition rewards across a variety of categories!
The Rules of the Competition
Please read and follow the competition rules to ensure a fair and enjoyable experience for all participants. These rules cover eligibility, participation requests, and conduct during the event.
Submission Requirements
Work must be deployed on or connected to GF/opBNB in some way.
Work that is open source and free for others to use.
Shared artifacts (GitHub, planning documents, and a short video).
Ensure the contract address has at least 2 successful transactions within the hackathon timeframe.
Tweet describing your project and tag #buildonBNBChain
For this hackathon, the project must be a new development in order to ensure equal opportunity
Please note that you do not need to pitch your idea to us. All we need is your submission.
Projects will be evaluated based on 1) functional prototype highlighting a solution, 2) creativity, 3) readiness of the dApp and 4) usability.
The Spirit of the Competition
Remember, hackathons are about learning, collaborating, and having fun. While some aim to win, most are here to explore new ideas. Keep the hacker spirit alive by working with other teams, mentoring newcomers, and enjoying yourself.
Join us in Istanbul for the BNB Chain Hackathon Istanbul, where innovation knows no bounds, and the future of blockchain technology is in your hands. Together, let's push the boundaries of what's possible and shape the future of finance and data management.
For more details, view the full rules of the competition at the bottom of this article.
Register now and see you at the hackathon!
Competition Rules - Further details
1. Eligibility:
Team Size:Teams may have a maximum of 5 hackers.
2. Participants Requests:
Hackers who have been accepted to compete on a team must not be event staff, volunteers, mentors, judges, sponsors, or anyone else with special access to the competition.
Participants, including organizers, volunteers, and sponsors, are available to offer teams guidance and assistance.
3. The hackathon is the only place where work can be done on a project.
4. Groups are allowed to implement a strategy they developed in advance of the competition.
5. Teams have the option of focusing on already completed ideas. There is no requirement for ""innovation"" in hacks. Anyone is welcome to contribute to a shared idea, and their work will be evaluated based on how well it is ""hacked."" (It's unusual to come across something wholly novel these days, and teams often aren't aware if they're recycling a concept.)
6. Groups are free to include third-party resources, such as code repositories, into their work. It is against the spirit of the guidelines to work on a project ahead of time and open-source it with the sole intention of using the code during the event.
7. It is acceptable to include additional functionality into ongoing projects. Winners will be determined solely based on the value of any new features or functionalities introduced during the hackathon.
8. When the clock runs out, teams must cease their hacking activities. After the allotted time has passed, however, teams are free to debug and make minor adjustments to their applications. e.g. It's acceptable to fix a bug that prevents you from demonstrating your hack if doing so involves adding only a few lines of code. You are not permitted to make any major alterations or introduce any new functionality.
9. Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers' discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, breaking the Code of Conduct, or other unsporting behaviour.

PREDA Scale-out Smart Contracts Hackathon,"👏🏻 Welcome to the Hackathon!
Welcome onboard! We're thrilled to introduce you to PREDA, a revolutionary programming model designed to scale out general smart contracts. This virtual hackathon is tailored for blockchain builders, developers, entrepreneurs, and anyone eager to supercharge the scalability of their DApps and protocols, harnessing the power of PREDA.
By participating in this event, you'll get your hands on powerful tools, dive into the latest technology sharing, and receive wholehearted support from experts who know the ins and outs of programming with PREDA.
Beyond that, there's a chance for you to snatch a piece of the 10K USDT reward pie, register for the hackathon now to secure a spot, and be part of this evolution!
📣 Introduce PREDA
PREDA is a novel programming model for scaling out any general smart contract. This is achieved by partitioning the smart contract state and dividing the transaction traffic, which are jointly handled by multiple independent virtual machines that can be distributed and parallelized.
We implemented the PREDA model by extending the Solidity language, which demonstrates that popular smart contracts with different levels of complexity can be rewritten to gain scalability without taking care of the details of the underlying distributed system.
Check out our PAPER to delve further into PREDA, and how PREDA extends Solidity to achieve significant performance and scalability advantages.

"Rebuild Ownership 2.0: Internet Privacy|DataverseOS, Filecoin","Overview
Internet privacy is crucial as it safeguards personal data, preserves autonomy, and protects against surveillance. It fosters trust in online interactions and ensures individuals can control what they share, making it fundamental in the digital age.
However, we’ve all had our data sold to third parties without consent, becoming the product of internet. This became one of the main goals for the new internet era - web3 to solve. In web3, privacy is a cornerstone of the decentralized internet, offering users greater control over their data and enhanced consent mechanisms, with technologies like DID, dStorage, ZKP, MPC and FHE.
「Rebuild Ownership」as a series global hackathon, is designed to gather the pioneer protocols in the space and offer hackers a holistic experience of tackling on internet privacy using web3 technologies. We are thrilled to have partners like Filecoin, Fhenix, etc.

About Linera
Initially inspired by the low-latency payment protocol FastPay developed at Meta, Linera is a layer-1 blockchain protocol designed to bring the elastic scaling of web2 to web3.
Linera introduces the idea of operating many lightweight chains, called microchains, in parallel in the same set of validators. Microchains communicate instantly using the internal network of each validator. Compared to traditional multi-chain systems, a benefit of running all the microchains in the same set of validators is that creating chains does not impact the security model.
In Linera, a validator is an elastic web2-like service that validates and executes all the chains. We call this the integrated multi-chain approach. The number of microchains present in the Linera system is theoretically unlimited. This is possible because only the chains being actively extended with new blocks require work from validators. Linera encourages validators to use data centers or cloud infrastructure to unlock elastic scaling and benefit from standard production environments.
To ensure decentralization, the Linera protocol uses proof-of-stake mechanisms together with scalable auditing procedures. Each microchain can also be separately executed on commodity hardware. This allows the network to be audited by the community in a distributed way to ensure full accountability of validators.
The aim is to make it as easy as possible for developers to build on Linera. The programming model of Linera does not depend on a specific programming language. We are using WebAssembly (Wasm) and Rust for the initial execution layer of Linera.
At present, Linera does not yet have a devnet, testnet, mainnet, or token.
By making multi-chain programming fast and scalable, we believe that a paradigm shift comparable to the evolution of databases from SQL to NoSQL is necessary for future decentralized systems to provide low-latency guarantees at arbitrary scale. We are excited to see how developers take advantage of this unique architecture and performance capabilities.

PEGO Network Hackthon,"Introduction
PEGO is a Web3 infrastructure that provides high autonomy, scalability, and sustainability for decentralized applications. PEGO has designed a fully community-driven autonomous Web3 infrastructure, where all on-chain parameters can be flexibly adjusted through proposals initiated by the community. According to the PPOS consensus, the established composite economic incentive mechanism can promote the sustainable development of the PEGO ecosystem. Additionally, the PEGO blockchain is fully compatible with the EVM system, making it ideal for developers aiming to build scalable decentralized applications.
As a sustainable Layer 1 blockchain, PEGO Network aims to build a blockchain for everyone. Since launching the mainnet over a month ago, PEGO has already achieved 800k+ token addresses, 1m transaction times, and PG token 24h transaction amount around 20m. PEGO Foundation has established Swap, Wallet, and Bridge based on the network.

Planq Long-Term Grant Program - Round Two,"Summary
After a successful first round, Planq and Dorahacks are teaming up to host the second round of the long-term developer grant program. Developers can complete tasks and receive rewards in Planq's native token $PLQ. This strategic collaboration aims to foster innovation and engage the developer community in enhancing Planq's ecosystem.
Planq is a secure, decentralized mobile-first layer 1 blockchain that combines the speed and interoperability of Cosmos with the developer power of Ethereum. Planq is building a feature-rich ecosystem of EVM-compatible applications accessible to anyone with a mobile phone. Planq runs a proof-of-stake consensus powered by its native $PLQ token.
The Planq Coin (PLQ) is the native currency of the Planq blockchain, built on the Cosmos-SDK and leveraging the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for smart contracts written in Solidity. It is using the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism which is realized with Tendermint technology. A key element of the Planq solution is the Cosmos-SDK which supports modular blockchain extensions, which can expand the chain functionality with ease.
Applications for the Planq blockchain can be coded using the Solidity language. Applications from Ethereum, and other EVM compatible applications, can be easily forked over and integrated into the Planq ecosystem.
The focus for Round 2 is on the following themes: NFT marketplace (priority), Dashboard( PlanqFi), EVM staking, KYC NFT, Decentralized identifiers (DIDs), Governance, Price tracker, Oracle, Mobile game, Mobile payment integrations, Move-2-earn, De-Pin.
Focus, however, does not mean that the themes are exhaustive. On the contrary, do you have an application that can really contribute something to the Planq ecosystem? Do not hesitate to apply. Please keep in mind that we prefer applications that fit into the mobile-first narrative. Planq is working on the tokenization of Real World Assets (RWA). Parallel to that, Planq invites builders to build RWA/tokenization infrastructure, protocols, and to launch their own RWA dApps on the Planq Blockchain.

Afropolitan AfroFuturism Hackathon,"Afropolitan and Near Protocol are offering $2,000 in bounties for the best hacks for the Afropolitan community built on the Near Ecosystem. Read Hackathon Guide
The bounty should match at least one of the following 3 themes below. One way to think about it is: “build an app that can be used by a group of people that hold an Afropolitan NFT”. This can be a web app, mobile app, chatbot, or any interface you want.
Hackathon Scoring
Afropolitan Integration

How well did you integrate Afropolitan into your product?
How well do you address one or more of the 3 themes?
Is there a link and logo to Afropolitan in your app?
Do you use Afropolitan Founding Citizen NFT token gating? (You can also use a replica of Afropolitan NFTs on other chains, see AfroShare tutorial)
Do you use Afropolitan branding?

Near BOS Integration

How well did you integrate Near BOS into your product?
How many custom components did you create?
How many Near and BOS APIs did you use?
What other tools in the Near Ecosystem do you use?
Prizes
1. 1st place - $1,000
2. 2nd place - $500 x 2
Themes
1. Identity & Annual Membership:
Developers are to create an application using the NEAR protocol to handle identity verification. This application should provide a robust mechanism to authenticate members of the Afropolitan community. It must be able to record essential member details and manage an annual membership subscription. Bonus points for incorporating a smart contract that automatically handles membership renewals or alerts members when their membership is about to expire.
2. Payments for Events, Travel & Social Activities:
The goal here is to build a secure, reliable, and easy-to-use payment system for community activities. The system must support payments for events, travel, and other social activities hosted by Afropolitan. It can integrate with the identity application (from the first theme) to verify member credentials during payment. Developers should prioritize the security and speed of transactions.
3. Rewards Program:
This theme is about fostering loyalty and engagement within the Afropolitan community. Participants are required to design a reward system that incentivizes members for their platform usage. The system should automatically track member interactions with the platform and allocate rewards accordingly. The more a member interacts, the higher the rewards they should earn. Special attention should be given to how this reward system is connected to the identity and payment systems from the previous themes."

FraxBuild Hackathon,"Introduction
Frax Finance is a stablecoin protocol that issues innovative, decentralized stablecoins and builds subprotocols to support them. Currently, the three stablecoins issued by Frax are FRAX (dollar-pegged), frxETH (ETH-pegged), and FPI (CPI-pegged) while subprotocols include Fraxlend, Fraxswap, and Fraxferry. FRAX is one of the largest decentralized stablecoins in existence with over $1 billion in circulation, frxETH has been able to become the largest LSDs with 128k validators live today, and FPI pioneered the concept of a stablecoin that is pegged to the consumer price index that is resistant to inflation.
Frax has been able to build a microcosm of DeFi within itself with a core team of devs in the single digits. Although they have been able to make great strides in development over the past few years, there is still much to be built and the Frax team cannot do it alone. That is why we are excited to announce FraxBuild, the first ever official hackathon of the Frax ecosystem. The goal for this hackathon is to:
Increase dev awareness of building on Frax and engaging with the developer community
Build products and primitives that compliment the Frax ecosystem of stablecoins and primitives
Educate developers about how they can integrate Frax into their protocols
FraxBuild is co-hosted by Frax Finance, Flywheel DeFi, and DoraHacks. From May 29th to July 25th, applicants will be able to submit their applications online for a chance to win over $50k worth of prizes in $FXS. Winner of the hackathon will be interviewed and have their product demo’don Flywheel DeFi.

About ZetaChain
ZetaChain is the foundational, public blockchain enabling omnichain, generic smart contracts and messaging between any blockchain. It solves the problems of “cross-chain” and “multi-chain” and opens the crypto and global financial ecosystem to anyone. ZetaChain supports a truly fluid, multi-chain crypto ecosystem, where users and developers can move between and appreciate the benefits of any blockchain: payments, DeFi, liquidity, games, art, social graphs, performance, security, privacy, and so on. The founding team has previously co-founded Basic Attention Token, has strong crypto product experience since 2013 and academia research backgrounds in top ranked US universities. Learn more about us here: https://link3.to/zetachain
Key features
Decentralized and public: ZetaChain is a decentralized and public blockchain network. It is built on Cosmos SDK and Tendermint Consensus. While many cross-chain solutions like bridges have varying, often centralized trust models that have a track record for being susceptible to exploits and hacks, ZetaChain is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain, where all transactions and activity on the platform -- even cross-chain transactions -- are fully transparent, verifiable, and function in a trust-minimized manner.
Hyper-connected nodes: ZetaChain's nodes have observers that monitor transactions on every connected chain. Through ZetaChain's TSS architecture, the network can sign and verify transactions on every connected chain as a wallet can. By being able to read and write to connected chains in a secure, decentralized manner, these hyper-connected nodes provide a seamless omnichain environment for developers to build novel and powerful cross-chain applications on top of.
Omnichain message passing: A developer can pass messages (data + value) between chains and layers with simple function calls. Through message passing, a dApp developer can build powerful cross-chain applications by simply implementing a few functions within their existing smart contracts.
Omnichain smart contracts: Smart contracts can be deployed natively on ZetaChain that can read/write to connected chains. ZetaChain is the only public blockchain to support smart contracts with this capability, enabling a new paradigm of app development.  
Managed external assets: ZetaChain's network and dApps built on top of ZetaChain can manage assets and vaults of external connected chains. This allows assets on any chain to be managed just as a smart contract on a single chain can manage assets on its respective chain. A dApp on ZetaChain can thus orchestrate and bring smart contract logic to any connected chain. This property applies to all chains, including non-smart-contract chains, like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.
Highlights
1.4 million total ZetaChain users (480k MTU), 10M+ cross chain transactions and 600k organically grown twitter community
Trust-minimized cross-chain asset and data transfer (No wrapped coins only native assets)
Easy deployment with one code base for Multichain DeFi (lending, staking, yield farming), NFTs, DAOs, governance, identity
Mainnet launch expected in June 2023 with major public upcoming engagements"

[EVMOS] EVM Extensions Hackathon,"Introduction
Welcome to Evmos’s first online hackathon with Dorahacks. The focus of these hackathons will center around our EVM Extensions.
What are EVM Extensions?
Evmos has introduced stateful precompiles called EVM Extensions, which are unique to its implementation. The ability of EVM Extensions on Evmos will unlock both blockchains and individual applications to customize and leverage the functionality of IBC and other Cosmos SDK modules. These extensions extend the EVM's capabilities beyond its original specification without compromising equivalence with Ethereum's execution layer.
With EVM Extensions, developers can create their own business logic for connecting with other smart contracts and appchains in the Cosmos ecosystem. Applications are no longer limited to a single blockchain and can make smart contract calls to IBC modules to communicate with other chains, securely send and receive assets across chains, stake EVMOS tokens, and even manage accounts on other blockchains to access any functionality built elsewhere.
Prize Pool
The prize pool (98k USDT) will break down as follow:

Leveraging EVM Extensions
1st: 17k USDT
2nd: 13k USDT
3rd: 8k USDT

Buidl on Evmos: Infrastructure & Toolings
1st: 10k USDT
2nd: 7k USDT
3rd: 3k USDT

Buidl on Evmos: DeFi
1st: 10k USDT
2nd: 7k USDT
3rd: 3k USDT

Buidl on Evmos: DAO & Community
1st: 10k USDT
2nd: 7k USDT
3rd: 3k USDT
(More prize pool may come from our ecosystem sponsors, TBA)

"Humanode ""Hack the Sybil"" Hackathon","Humanode is excited to announce the Humanode hackathon. The hackathon will be two weeks long, running from June 2, 2022 - July 27, 2022.
The hackathon will include a series of educational workshops that teach participants to build decentralized applications on the Humanode network.
The Humanode network is a protocol that can prove one's unique identity through private biometric authentication schemes and grant permission to launch a node and verify transactions running a public permissionless network based on collective human existence.
Humanode is the first truly distributed network where infrastructure is in the hands of people, not profit-driven businesses participating in mining or staking. Humanode crypto-biometric solution is a layer-1 technology, and is built as an EVM Compatible Substrate chain. Private biometrics help fight Sybil not only on infrastructure level but on the Dapp level as well. The direct biometric API allows NFT projects, DAOs, GameFi, metaverse, and other Dapps to integrate and enable unique online identities which stay private. Humanode is already joined by over 2600 unique human validators, and is in the process of launching testnet v3 in May 2022. Mainnet is scheduled to launch this summer.
Join Discord for more support: https://link.humanode.io/chat/hackathon
Timeline
Workshops will take place during the Humanode Conference (we will provide links to videos for those who can't attend the conference)
Workshop: Sybil-resistance for apps with Humanode OAuth 2 Service - 30th of May
Workshop: Connecting to Humanode chain - 30th of May
Opening Ceremony: June 2nd (12:00 noon UTC)
Submission Due Date: July 27th (12:00 noon UTC)
Demo day: July 28th
Winners anouncement: Early August
Requirements
You can use any technology you want to, and build anything you want. Just make sure to utilize the principle of Sybil-resistance.
Sybil-resistant dapps are not subject to multi-account attacks. Humanode validators are unique human beings. You as a developer can make sure that there is only one person behind the web-3 account in our blockchain and your platform.
Tech integration
Ways you integrate Humanode:
Humanode API: Biometric Sybil-resistance for dapps
Humanode chain: EVM-compatible network based on equal human nodes
Five Tracks
DAO: Build 1p1v or new models of governance other than token-based voting.
UI/UX: Use private biometric authentication to improve web3 experience.
Chain tools: Build the first generation of tools for Humanode chain exploration, analysis or dev tooling.
Dapps for human nodes: Help human nodes (validators) organize, manage and automate all things connected to being an integral part of the network.
Special track: There are endless possibilities across industries: social networks, art, gaming, finance, governance, public goods and other.
Prizes
There will be rewards worth $30,000 in total. $6000 for each track. More rewards TBA from Humanode partners.
Judging
All projects will be reviewed by the Humanode Team to determine whether the project submissions meet the minimum level of viability with respect to theme and submission requirements according to the hackathon rules.
After the hackathon, you can apply for a grant program which will launch in Q3 2022 after the main net launch. Reputable VCs among our partners and sponsors are here hunting for great ideas and teams

What is Humanode all about!?
In short, Humanode is the first crypto-biometric network where one human = one node = one vote that brings Sybil resistance and innovative governance models to the crypto industry using private biometric technology.
In other words, the Humanode consensus model is not based on Proof of Work, or Proof of Stake. Humanode is based on Proof of Existence and Proof of Uniqueness.
One identity (one person) is only able to launch one validator node. Each node has one vote. Which means, that no matter how much money you have, or how big of a company you are, your voting power in the DAO is the same as you and me. One vote. This also means that there are no “mining pools” or “staking pools”. All transaction fees and earnings from the system are shared equally amongst all validator nodes.
How does this work?
To get the right to launch a node, a potential human node will go through a live video based 3D face scan and liveness detection, to prove that they are living human beings. Biometric data is encrypted before leaving the user’s phone. Connection between the client and server is end-to-end encrypted. Biometric data is stored, decrypted and processed in a distributed network of secure enclaves - Intel SGXs and AMD SEV. Liveness detection data is verified during the face scanning session and deleted right after it. One point to note is that it is impossible to go through authentication without liveness. People running the encrypted servers are appointed by Humanode DAO and unable to see the data inside.
Once the biometric checks, which take less than a minute, are done, one can become a human node and participate in the consensus validating all sorts of transactions and smart contracts.
The same bio-authorization scheme also works for dapps and crypto protocols.
So, what makes this so special?
The answer is simple. Humanode is the first truly distributed network where infrastructure is in the hands of people, not profit-driven businesses participating in mining or staking. Humanode crypto-biometric solution is a layer-1 technology, and is built as an EVM Compatible Substrate chain.
Private biometrics help fight Sybil not only on infrastructure level but on the Dapp level as well. The direct biometric API allows NFT projects, DAOs, GameFi, metaverse, and other Dapps to integrate and enable unique online identities which stay private. One of Humanode’s first partnerships was with AIKON, who is known for ORE ID, a secure web3 login experience for crypto asset management without the need to mess with private keys. Humanode also has a number of partnerships that will be announced soon, and a number of integrations that are ongoing.
Humanode is already joined by over 2600 unique human validators, and is in the process of launching testnet v3 in May 2022. Mainnet is scheduled to launch this summer.

REQUIREMENTS
HACKATHON TRACKS
The hackathon has six super impactful tracks that place participants at the forefront of Web3. You choose which category you wish to compete in:
1 SocialFi. Your submission must be decentralized social media that incorporates tokenization (""social media"" is defined broadly). For example, you might give out tokens to users that refer other users to your service, who post content that is appreciated, help with moderation, or do something else that is helpful. Show the world how good next-generation social media owned by its community can be!
2 GameFi. Your submission must be a decentralized game that incorporates tokenization (""games"" is defined broadly). For example, the game experince could be built from JavaScript, or an engine like Unity, and served from the Internet Computer into the browser, then interacting with backend blockchain code running on the Internet Computer. The game must involve tokens as incentives or prizes. It could be a multi-player card game, or space invaders that pays out bitcoin when the high score is beaten. You should have a plan to defeat cheating, for example using dynamically inserted CAPTCHAs. Help make sure Web3 gaming is game on!
3 Metaverse and NFTs. Your submission must incorporate a system or code framework that supports building decentralized metaverses (""metaverse"" is defined broadly). If you want to take on laying the foundations for an actual decentralized metaverse, of course you can do that too! For example, you could submit a system that sells online real estate as NFTs, or enables multiple players to interact inside a virtual space. Or you could show how a powerful gaming engine can be repurposed for use in the metaverse. Join the grand mission to make sure the metaverse is decentralized and open!
4 Asynchronous DeFi. When a blockchain transaction invokes a smart contract on old-school blockchains, and it calls another contract, which calls another, and another, the functions of the different contracts run on a single call stack. This makes them very insecure thanks to re-entrancy, which has been one of the biggest sources of hacks on blockchain to date. Another problem is that transactions must be run in sequence, which creates a firm upper bound on transaction throughput. On the Internet Computer, smart contract calls run in parallel, because smart contracts (called ""canisters"") are ""software actors"". This removes a key security vulnerability, and provides for the unbounded, efficient scaling of blockchain computation. Now create a 100% on-chain and scalable auction house for NFTs, or a decentralized exchange for tokens. Or create a software library that helps others with the new way of coding DeFi. Or write code that interacts with other blockchains. Be a trailblazer for a new DeFi paradigm!
5 Public Good / Social Impact. Tokens create powerful incentives that can help new services and ventures succeed. But blockchain is not just about ""success"" in the conventional sense. The world faces many difficulties, including climate change, pollution, war, oppression, economic inequality, and fake news. This is your chance to build something that makes a difference, in whatever field you choose!
6 Blue Sky. Are you feeling constrained by the foregoing categories? Compete in this category and build anything you like, as long as it involves the Internet Computer!


JUDGING CRITERIA & PROCESS
All projects will be reviewed by the Supernova Hackathon Team to determine whether the project submissions meet the minimum level of viability with respect to theme and submission requirements according to the hackathon rules. Each project submission must include a video demonstration of what your team built. Each video must be a minimum of 5 minutes. You must also provide access to your repository of code by uploading your files. Once approved, these projects will post to the DoraHacks project gallery. If you need any help uploading your project submission, please contact us.
The panel of judges will review all submissions that are approved to the DoraHacks gallery of projects based on the equally-weighted judging criteria detailed below. Prizes are awarded to winners based on the scores assigned to their projects by the judges.
X Factor and Potential: What is the wow factor of the idea? Does it have potential?

Technical Competence: Does this project solve a real-world problem? Can people use it?

Social Impact: Does this project have the potential to affect the world in a meaningful way?

Progression: Can a library be used? Is a service actually usable? How far did you go?

IC Factor: Have you managed to leverage and demo a unique platform capability?
In the event of a tie, the tied submission with the highest IC Factor score will be considered the higher scoring submission. If two or more submissions are tied on the IC Factor score, the panel of judges will vote on the tied submissions.

BUIDL NFT Loot Box Hackathon,"BUIDL NFT LOOT BOX HACKATHON kicks off! Design Your Programmable Rewards!
BUIDL NFT is a way to fund open-source developers on hackerlink.io. Every BUIDL on the platform can be minted to be a BUIDL NFT and the minted BUIDL NFTwill then become tradable continuously. The subsequent transaction will only be made at a higher price because the bid has to be higher than the current price each round and thus the higher bidder is privileged to buy it. As per referred, BUIDL NFT helps the BUIDL owners to get funded in the long-term - every time the BUIDL NFT is traded, the minter will get rewards.
Traders, as supporters of the BUIDL and BUIDL NFT, can also yield from trading the spread. BUIDL NFT minters can customize benefits for the traders with codes using “Loot Box”. A loot box is a smart contract that contains any programmable behavior after a successful BUIDL NFT transaction.
A Loot Box design can be enriched from the perspective of transaction time, transaction price, holding time, etc., you name it. The programmable benefits are a hacker's way to reward their supporters.
Loot Box can have such use cases including but not limited to: airdrop, whitelisting, token swap, NFT reward, on-chain registration. Don’t limit your imagination!
From November 20, 2021 to January 10, 2022, BUIDL NFT LOOT BOX HACKATHON will go live on HackerLink to motivate BUIDLers to design more innovative andnteresting Loot Box benefits through prize sponsorship and promotional support in order toinspire the community to participate in trading Loot Box！
